#### **1. Motivation**

In daily life, spending habits and academic engagement can reflect broader patterns of behavior and priorities. Entertainment spending, a discretionary activity, may influence or correlate with class attendance, an essential part of academic performance. This project seeks to analyze my personal financial and academic habits by studying the relationship between daily entertainment spending and the number of classes I attend.

The objectives of this analysis are as follows:

- Gain a better understanding of the relationship between discretionary spending and academic commitment.  
- Identify patterns in my daily behaviors to improve both financial and academic management.  
- Present an insightful case study that may inspire further exploration in behavioral data analysis.

#### **2. Data Source**

##### **Data Collection Process**
1. **Spending Data:**
   - Source: Daily entertainment spending data will be extracted from Akbank’s digital banking platform.
   - Variables: Entertainment spending amounts in Turkish Lira (₺) recorded daily.
2. **Class Attendance Data:**
   - Source: Daily class schedules and attendance records will be collected from my personal calendar or academic portal.
   - Variables: Number of classes attended daily.  
3. **Duration:**
   - Data will be collected over a period of 30 consecutive days to ensure enough variability for analysis.  
4. **Additional Notes:**
   - Contextual events (e.g., exam periods, holidays) that may influence spending or attendance will be documented to account for outliers.

##### **Data Features**
- **Primary Variables:**
  - Entertainment spending (in Turkish Lira, ₺).  
  - Number of classes attended.  
- **Daily Records:** One record per day with both variables.  
- **Additional Notes:** Annotated events that could significantly affect spending or attendance.

#### **3. Data Analysis**

##### **3.1 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
- Handle missing data entries or inconsistencies.
- Convert all spending values to a common currency (₺).  
- Normalize values to account for any extreme outliers or anomalies (e.g., unusually high spending days due to specific events).  

##### **3.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Descriptive Statistics:**
  - Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation for both spending and attendance.  
- **Visualization:**
  - Plot histograms to show distributions of spending and class attendance.
  - Create time-series plots to visualize daily trends.  

##### **3.3 Correlation Analysis**
- **Correlation Coefficients:**
  - Compute Pearson Correlation to assess the linear relationship between spending and attendance.
  - Use Spearman Correlation to evaluate potential non-linear relationships.  
- **Scatter Plots:**
  - Create scatter plots with regression lines to visualize the relationship between spending and attendance.

##### **3.4 Additional Analyses**
- Analyze trends in spending and attendance between weekdays and weekends.  
- Identify any patterns or outliers associated with specific events (e.g., holidays, exams).  
- Explore potential lagged correlations (e.g., spending the night before impacting next-day attendance).  

##### **3.5 Tools and Methods**
- **Python:** Use libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  
- **Excel/Google Sheets:** As a supplementary tool for tracking data and performing basic analysis.

#### **4. Expected Outcomes**
1. If a correlation exists, the nature of the correlation (positive, negative, or neutral) will be identified.  
2. Insights into how daily financial decisions may impact academic habits.  
3. Recommendations for balancing spending and academic commitment based on identified patterns.  
4. A detailed report and visualizations that summarize findings and propose actionable strategies.
